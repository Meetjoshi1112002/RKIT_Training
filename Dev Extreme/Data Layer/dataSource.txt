The DataSource allows specifying CustomStore properties in its configuration object, as shown in the following code:

Understanding the Communication Between Component and DataSource
Let’s break it down step by step:

1️⃣ How is Data Passed from dxSelectBox to dataSource?

When dxSelectBox initializes, it receives dataSource as its data provider.
dataSource fetches data from ArrayStore and filters, sorts, or groups it before sending it to the component.

2️⃣ What Happens When You Type in the Search Box?
The onInput event gets triggered.
We update dataSource.filter() with the search term.
dataSource.load() reloads the data with the updated filter.
myselectbox.option("dataSource", dataSource) reconnects the filtered data to the UI.


3️⃣ Why is dxSelectBox Not Handling Pagination?
dxSelectBox loads all data into memory at once, so it does not paginate results.
Pagination only works when dataSource is connected to dxDataGrid or dxList, which display multiple items at once.
