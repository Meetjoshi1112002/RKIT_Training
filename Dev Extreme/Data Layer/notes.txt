Yes, exactly! CustomStore is responsible for communicating with the backend, while dataSource always operates on the client side.

üîπ How They Work Together?
1Ô∏è‚É£ CustomStore: Fetches data from the backend based on parameters (skip, take, sort, filter, etc.).
2Ô∏è‚É£ DataSource: Acts as a middle layer, managing client-side operations like binding data to UI components (Grid, List, etc.).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Server-Side Mode: When remoteOperations is true, dataSource delegates filtering, sorting, and pagination to CustomStore, which in turn fetches processed data from the backend.

üîπ Example Flow
(A) Client-Side Processing (Default)
1Ô∏è‚É£ dataSource requests all data from CustomStore.
2Ô∏è‚É£ CustomStore fetches everything from the backend.
3Ô∏è‚É£ dataSource applies sorting, filtering, and pagination on the frontend.

(B) Server-Side Processing (Optimized)
1Ô∏è‚É£ dataSource requests only the required page, with sorting/filtering options.
2Ô∏è‚É£ CustomStore sends these parameters (skip, take, sort, filter) to the backend.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Backend processes the request and returns only the required data.
4Ô∏è‚É£ dataSource binds the fetched data to the UI.


Conclusion
CustomStore ‚Üí Fetches the right data from the backend.
DataSource ‚Üí Manages how data is displayed in UI components.
In Server-Side Mode: dataSource delegates work to CustomStore, and CustomStore tells the backend what data to return.
In Client-Side Mode: dataSource does everything after fetching data from CustomStore.
